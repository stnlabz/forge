# Forge
The ChAoS Forge

The forge represents the development cycle, from the Academy to the store via the sandbox.

## Typical expected flow
 - Student enrolls and learns about module development
   1. **Student** creates a module in the Sandbox
   2. **Forge Master** ensures the module's correctness and compliance
   3. **Instructors** dig through the code 
   4. **Approved/Not Approved** based on the things above.
   - If not approved, **student** is urged to try again.
   - If approved, **student** becomes a **Certified** ChAoS Module Developer.
     1. The student sets the selling price on the module
     2. Forge Master lists the module on the ChAoS Shop

  - Module Developer
